			<h3>OSCAAR - An Open Source Photometry Code For Everyone</h3>
			<a href="http://oscaar.github.io/OSCAAR/"><img class="rightPhoto" src="images/OSCAARlogoForWeb.png" alt="OSCAAR logo"></a>

			<p class="advisor">Check this project out on <a href="https://github.com/OSCAAR/OSCAAR">GitHub</a>!</p>
			<p>
			The Open Source differential photometry Code for Amateur Astronomical Research, or
			<a href="http://oscaar.github.io/OSCAAR/">OSCAAR</a> is a project I started as an undergraduate
			at the University of Maryland. I wanted to study extrasolar planets using the small telescopes
			at the University of Maryland Observatory, so I wrote up a package of Python tools for differential
			photometry with a specific focus on applying it to exoplanet transit photometry with small observatories.
			After I started regularly producing light curves with the code I formed teams to help develop
			OSCAAR as it is today, with a friendly graphical user interface and lots of documentation.
			<br><br>
			OSCAAR is intended to be a Python package for undergraduates or advanced amateurs who have
			access to basic observing facilities and want to get their hands dirty with transit
			photometry. It is meant to be an easy to use, graphical package for everything you
			need from planning which transits to observe, to producing light curves from
			raw FITS data, to fitting analytical models to those light curves.
			<br><br>
			Since I worked on OSCAAR a bit while I was at NASA's Goddard Space
			Flight Center with support from Dr. Avi Mandell (GSFC), NASA wrote up a
			<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-funded-program-helps-amateur-astronomers-detect-alien-worlds/">
			great press release</a> on the project that got some fun traction in the media.

			Light takes time to travel, so observers on other planets would see Earth

			observers on known exoplanets would see if they looked up at Earth right now?
