			<h3>OSCAAR - An Open Source Photometry Code For Everyone</h3>
			<a href="http://oscaar.github.io/OSCAAR/"><img id="rightPhoto" src="images/OSCAARlogoForWeb.png" alt="OSCAAR logo"></a>

			<p class="advisor">Check this project out on <a href="https://github.com/OSCAAR/OSCAAR">GitHub</a>!</p>			
			The Open Source differential photometry Code for Amateur Astronomical Research, or
			<a href="http://oscaar.github.io/OSCAAR/">OSCAAR</a> is a project I started as an undergraduate
			at the University of Maryland. I wanted to study extrasolar planets using the small telescopes
			at the University of Maryland Observatory, so I wrote up a package of Python tools for differential
			photometry with a specific focus on applying it to exoplanet transit photometry with small observatories.
			After I started regularly producing light curves with the code I formed teams to help develop
			OSCAAR as it is today, with a friendly graphical user interface and lots of documentation.
			<br><br>
			OSCAAR is intended to be a Python package for undergraduates or advanced amateurs who have
			access to basic observing facilities and want to get their hands dirty with transit
			photometry. It is meant to be an easy to use, graphical package for everything you
			need from planning which transits to observe, to producing light curves from
			raw FITS data, to fitting analytical models to those light curves.
			<br><br>
			Since I worked on OSCAAR a bit while I was at NASA's Goddard Space
			Flight Center with support from Dr. Avi Mandell (GSFC), NASA wrote up a
			<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-funded-program-helps-amateur-astronomers-detect-alien-worlds/">
			great press release</a> on the project that got some fun traction in the media.

			<h3>Photometry of Transiting Extrasolar Planets with Kepler, the Hale Telescope (Palomar Observatory)

			<a href="images/kpnoJun2012.jpg"><img id="leftPhoto" src="images/kpnoJun2012.png" alt="Goddard Center for Astrobiology Research Associates, 2012"></a>
			<p class="advisor">with <a href="http://www.astro.umd.edu/people/ddeming.html">Professor Drake Deming</a> (UMD)
			and <a href="http://astrobiology.gsfc.nasa.gov/mandell/">Dr. Avi Mandell</a> (NASA-GSFC)</p>
			I have been working with public Kepler data and ground based observations from the Palomar and Kitt Peak Observatories
			since June 2012, beginning during my time as a Research Associate in the Goddard Center
			for Astrobiology at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. I study extrasolar planet HAT-P-7b, a
			fascinating hot Jupiter that orbits its star at a distance of only 4 stellar radii. I worked with observations from
			the Palomar Observatory's Hale Telescope to search for the secondary eclipse in the K-band.
			<br><br>
			By compiling all of the available Kepler observations, I have resolved photometric features consistent with planet-induced stellar
			gravity darkening, in which the tidal distortion of the star due to the planet causes a decrease in the surface gravity near the
			sub-planet region, resulting in a corresponding decrease in stellar surface brightness. I wrote a Letter on this work was accepted
			to <i>ApJ Letters</i> on Jan 18, 2013, <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...764L..22M">view it here</a>.
			<br><br>I also got to travel to Kitt Peak National Observatory as a co-investigator for a week of observing time in June 2012 to
			observe exoplanet transits on the 2.1 m with Professor Pedro Sada (U de M). The picture above shows the view I enjoyed
			from the 2.1 m at sunset during monsoon season (<a class="cite" href="images/kpnoJun2012.jpg">click to enlarge</a>).
			<br><br>I am excited to announce that been invited back to NASA Goddard as a research assistant to work on near-infrared
			spectroscopic observations of exoplanet atmospheres
			with Dr. Avi Mandell in the spring and summer of 2013.

			<h3>Honors Thesis: Numerical Simulations of Rotational Fission of Contact Binary Asteroids (UMD)</h3>

			<p class="advisor">with <a href="http://www.astro.umd.edu/~dcr/">Professor Derek C. Richardson</a> (UMD)</p>
			I was nominated for Departmental Honors in 2011 and I defended my thesis in May 2012. My project investigates
			the analytically derived relative configurations of contact binary asteroids that are spun-up by continous
			torques such as the YORP effect. I developed a Python-based initial conditions generator to model a variety of
			asteroid geometries with accurate moments of inertia and symmetry for comparison with analytical studies on
			idealized asteroid bodies. I interfaced with an N-body gravity integrator called pkdgrav and used more than
			4 years of CPU time on our campus' high performance computing centers. 
			A publication is in preparation for submission to <i>Icarus</i>.

			<h3>Photometric Studies at the University of Maryland Observatory (UMD)</h3>
			<!--<p class="advisor">with <a href="http://www.astro.umd.edu/openhouse/">Elizabeth Warner</a> (UMD)</p>-->
			<h5>Transiting Exoplanet Observations</h5><p>
			I have worked on various projects at the University of Maryland Observatory (UMO) since the summer of 2011.
			That summer I worked on my <a href="#asteroids">honors thesis</a> during the day, and by night I developed my own observing techniques and
			original differential photometry code to become the first person to detect extrasolar planets at UMO. Since then,
			I have collected transit photometry for >10 exoplanets and released an <a href="#oscaar">
			open source version of my photometry code, <q>OSCAAR</q></a> (see above). Some of my observations have been submitted to the
			<a href="http://var2.astro.cz/EN/tresca/transits.php?pozor=Brett+Morris&submit=show+...">Exoplanet Transit Database</a>
			maintained by the Czech Astronomical Society to help constrain ephemerides. My publication
			<a href="http://www.scientificterrapin.umd.edu/Fall2011.php"><q>Observations of Transiting Exoplanets with Differential
			Photometry</q></a> was accepted to the <i>Scientific Terrapin</i>, a research journal at the University of Maryland,
			in the Fall of 2011 (p. 18-24).

			<h5>Asteroid Observations</h5><p>
			I have used my photometry code to study asteroids as well. In Febraury 2011, there was a season of mutual
			eclipse events for binary asteroid Kalliope and its satellite Linus. I measured photometry of the system
			on two nights to measure the decrease in brightness when Linus' shadow passed over Kalliope. My results were
			featured in the presentation at Asteroids Comets and Meteors in Japan (2012). Read the talk's abstract, entitled
			<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012LPICo1667.6352S"><q>Physical and orbital properties
			of the (22) Kalliope system from mutual eclipse observations.</q></a>

		<h3 id="earlyWork">Early work: CCDs for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope at Brookhaven National Laboratories</h3>
		<p>
			I was lucky enough to attend a high school with a competitive science research program, and in
			my junior year of high school I worked with Dr. James Frank at Brookhaven National Laboratories in Upton, NY. I
			characterized the point spread functions of prototype charged coupled devices (CCDs) for the
			<a href="http://www.lsst.org/lsst/">Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)</a>, a new, massive survey telescope.
			I got some great hands-on experience in detector physics and I got my hands dirty with Python for the first time - I've never looked back.
			I took this work to numerous science competitions with my work on this project,
			entitled <q>Examining the Point Spread Function of a Candidate Charge Coupled Device for the LSST with an Optical Point Projector.</q>
			I took first in Physics and Astronomy at both the New York Science and Engineering Fair and the Long Island
			Science and Engineering Fair.
