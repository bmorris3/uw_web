			<h3>Giant Exoplanet Transmission Spectroscopy with Keck/MOSFIRE in the Near-Infrared (2013-present at UW)</h3>
			<img class="leftPhoto" src="images/keckbrettmorrissmall.png" alt="Keck Observatory, 2014">

			and Daniel Angerhausen (NASA GSFC)</p>
			<p>
			Since my post-baccalaureate position at NASA Goddard I have been working to use Keck's 
			near-infrared multiobject spectrograph MOSFIRE to do do transit transmission 
			spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres. My collaborators and I have developed observing techniques and 
			data reduction and analysis pipelines for MOSFIRE observations and have built 
			exposure time calculators for exoplanet characterization with MOSFIRE that demonstrate the promise of
			ground-based transmission spectroscopy in the near-infrared.
			<br><br>
			In 2014 I was principal investigator on a two night run on MOSFIRE (N132M)
			with my NASA collaborators. We observed a pair of <q>twin hot-Jupiters</q>
			that each have similar masses, radii and effective temperatures but host stars
			with metallicities that differ by a factor of three. Using transit 
			transmission spectroscopy, we intend to show that the metallicity difference
			of the planets can be detected with spectroscopy from the ground.

			<p>
			I worked with public Kepler data and ground based observations from the Palomar and Kitt Peak Observatories
			in June 2012, beginning during my time as a Research Associate in the Goddard Center
			for Astrobiology at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. I study extrasolar planet HAT-P-7 b, a
			hot Jupiter that orbits its star at a distance of only four stellar radii. I worked with observations from
			the Palomar Observatory's Hale Telescope to search for the secondary eclipse in the K-band.
			<br><br>
			By compiling all of the available Kepler observations, I resolved photometric features in
			the light curves consistent with planet-induced stellar gravity darkening, in which the 
			tidal distortion of the star due to the planet causes a decrease in the surface gravity near the
			sub-planet point, resulting in a corresponding decrease in stellar surface brightness. 
			I wrote a Letter on this work in <i>ApJ Letters</i> in 2013, <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...764L..22M">view it here</a>.
			<br><br>I also travelled to Kitt Peak National Observatory as a co-investigator for a week of observing time in June 2012 to
			observe exoplanet transits on the 2.1 m with Professor Pedro Sada (U de M). The picture above shows the view I enjoyed
			from the 2.1 m at sunset during monsoon season.

			<p>
			I was nominated for Departmental Honors in 2011 and I defended my thesis in May 2012. My project investigates
			the analytically derived relative configurations of contact binary asteroids that are spun-up by continous
			torques such as the YORP effect. I developed a Python-based initial conditions generator to model a variety of
			asteroid geometries with accurate moments of inertia and symmetry for comparison with analytical studies on
			idealized asteroid bodies. I interfaced with an N-body gravity integrator called pkdgrav and used more than
			4 years of CPU time on our campus' high performance computing centers.

			<h3>Photometric Studies at the University of Maryland Observatory (2010-2013 at UMD)</h3>
			<!--<p class="advisor">with <a href="http://www.astro.umd.edu/openhouse/">Elizabeth Warner</a> (UMD)</p>-->
			<h5>Transiting Exoplanet Observations</h5>
			<p>
			I have worked on various projects at the University of Maryland Observatory (UMO) since the summer of 2011.
			That summer I worked on my <a href="#asteroids">honors thesis</a> during the day, and by night I developed my own observing techniques and
			original differential photometry code to become the first person to detect extrasolar planets at UMO. Since then,
			I have collected transit photometry for >10 exoplanets and released an <a href="#oscaar">
			open source version of my photometry code, <q>OSCAAR</q></a>. Some of my observations have been submitted to the
			<a href="http://var2.astro.cz/EN/tresca/transits.php?pozor=Brett+Morris&amp;submit=show+...">Exoplanet Transit Database</a>
			maintained by the Czech Astronomical Society to help constrain ephemerides. My publication
			<a href="http://www.scientificterrapin.umd.edu/Fall2011.php"><q>Observations of Transiting Exoplanets with Differential
			Photometry</q></a> was accepted to the <i>Scientific Terrapin</i>, a research journal at the University of Maryland,
			in the Fall of 2011 (p. 18-24). 
			</p>

			<h5>Asteroid Observations</h5>
			<p>
			I have used my photometry code to study asteroids as well. In Febraury 2011, there was a season of mutual
			eclipse events for binary asteroid Kalliope and its satellite Linus. I measured photometry of the system
			on two nights to measure the decrease in brightness when Linus' shadow passed over Kalliope. My results were
			featured in the presentation at Asteroids Comets and Meteors in Japan (2012). Read the talk's abstract, entitled 
			<q><a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012LPICo1667.6352S">Physical and orbital properties
			of the (22) Kalliope system from mutual eclipse observations.</a></q>

		<h3 id="earlyWork">Early work: CCDs for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope at Brookhaven National Laboratories</h3>
		<div>
			<p>
			I was lucky enough to attend a high school with a competitive science research program, and in
			my junior year of high school I worked with Dr. James Frank at Brookhaven National Laboratories in Upton, NY. I
			characterized the point spread functions of prototype charged coupled devices (CCDs) for the
			<a href="http://www.lsst.org/lsst/">Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)</a>, a new, massive survey telescope.
			I got some great hands-on experience in detector physics and I got my hands dirty with Python for the first time - I've never looked back.
			I took this work to numerous science competitions with my work on this project,
			entitled <q>Examining the Point Spread Function of a Candidate Charge Coupled Device for the LSST with an Optical Point Projector.</q>
			I took first in Physics and Astronomy at both the New York Science and Engineering Fair and the Long Island
			Science and Engineering Fair.
