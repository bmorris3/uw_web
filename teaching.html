		<h3>"SUMO": Mentoring undergraduates</h3>
		<p>
			I am advising six undergraduates on their College Park Scholars <q>Capstone</q>
			Project requirement. These students are working with me to further develop my open
			source differential photometry code, oscaar (see <a href="research.html#umo">Research Interests</a>),
			to make it more user friendly and more widely used in the amateur/small osbervatory
			communities. Some are being taught to code in Python, while others are being taught to code HTML
			and CSS to build our own online database of photometric observations taken with oscaar.
		</p>

		<h3>AstroTerps</h3>
		<p>
			I was the proud president of the University of Maryland's student astronomical society,
			the <q><a href="http://www.astro.umd.edu/~astroterp/">AstroTerps</a></q> from 2011-2012. I arranged
			and moderated weekly meetings with speakers from the Departments of Astronomy and Physics who speak
			to undergraduates of all majors. We took trips to the University of Maryland Observatory
			and dark sky locations throughout the region, and I promoted activism to fight light pollution
			in the campus community.

		<h3>College Park Scholars Peer Mentoring</h3>
		<p>
			I was nominated to serve as a Peer Mentor for freshmen members in College
			Park Scholars in 2010. Peer Mentors act as peer advisors for academic and
			residential life in the Scholars living-learning program. 
		</p>
	
		<h3>Volunteer work: National Air and Space Museum</h3>
		<p>
			In 2011, I volunteered more than 100 hours at the National Air and Space
			Museum in downtown Washington, D.C., where I served at Visitor Services. There I helped
			direct visitors around the museum to the most interesting artifacts and helped
			them access detailed information about them. What cooler place is there to volunteer than
			next to the Apollo 8 capsule, under the Spirit of St. Louis, surrounded by other enthusiastic
			aero/space nerds? Nowhere!
